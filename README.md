## Getting Started

*The API is fairly low-level at the moment*

Load a problem

```ruby
problem =
  Glpk.load_problem(
    obj_dir: :minimize,
    obj_coef: [8, 10],
    mat_ia: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3],
    mat_ja: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
    mat_ar: [2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 1],
    col_kind: [:integer, :continuous],
    col_lower: [0, 0],
    col_upper: [1e30, 1e30],
    row_lower: [7, 12, 6],
    row_upper: [1e30, 1e30, 1e30]
  )
```

Solve

```ruby
problem.solve
```

Write the problem to an LP or MPS file

```ruby
problem.write_lp("hello.lp")
# or
problem.write_mps("hello.mps")
```

Read a problem from an LP or MPS file

```ruby
problem = Glpk.read_lp("hello.lp")
# or
problem = Glpk.read_mps("hello.mps")
```

## Reference

Set the message level

```ruby
problem.solve(message_level: 4) # 0 = off, 4 = max
```

Set the time limit in seconds

```ruby
problem.solve(time_limit: 30)
```
